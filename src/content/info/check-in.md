# Preparing for Camping

Make sure you come to camp with **all the items an animal needs to live for the weekend**. TRC is **10 miles away from the nearest grocery store**. There is potable water, but bring water jugs since the tap is a fair walk away from camp. For the full list of items TRC recommends, see [their list of what to bring here.](https://www.camptrc.org/What-to-Bring)

# Checking into Camp

1. Check-in at the Host Hut in the lower camping log.
2. Unload your car (wheelbarrows are provided by TRC) to your site.
3. Move your car to the permanent parking lot, TRC does not have space at the tent sites for your car. The lower lot is pretty small and will be busy during check-in, if you need help with unloading let us know!
4. Check-in for event registration at Junkyard dogs!

# While you're camping

1. TRC is clothing optional, but keep yourself covered while crossing the street~
2. Keep your food stashed in the storage unit near the host hut -- The only critters we want cruising through camp are the ones attending our campout :3
3. Lost? Looking for activities? Junkyard Dogs will be our basecamp!
