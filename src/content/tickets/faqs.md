# Ticket Types

### Sharing a tent?
If someone is staying in your tent, **include the "Existing Tent" ticket type when ordering**, or you can add that ticket for them when you check out. ***Be sure to include your site number during checkout.***

**Note**: TRC charges per person, not per campsite, so everyone needs their own camping arrangement—either through this event, a direct booking with TRC, or by joining an existing tent.

### Looking for RV spots?
Book directly through TRC and choose the **BYO camping ticket option** - [TRC RV booking page](https://www.camptrc.org/RV-Reservations-(NEW!))


### Final Note

Charges are filed under the non-profit organization **undefined**. It's not a technical glitch!

Once you’ve checked out, you won’t be able to change your tag name or TRC member details. Don’t worry—we’ll follow up with everyone about 30 days before the event to provide a way to update that info.
