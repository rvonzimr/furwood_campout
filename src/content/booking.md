## How to Book Your Spot at Furwood

Follow these steps to get registered and join the pack:

### 1. New to Camp TRC?
You’ll need a Limited Membership to camp. It’s free and easy to sign up:  
[https://camptrc.org/Join](https://camptrc.org/Join)

If you want to support the campground year-round, you’re also welcome to become a Regular Member and be part of the amazing TRC community.

---

### 2. Already camped at TRC or just signed up?
Go to your profile page:  
[https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile](https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile)

Take note of the following:
- **Your membership level**: It should say "Limited Membership - Free" or "Regular Membership."
- **Your User ID**: You’ll need this for your ticket.

---

### 3. Check your renewal date
Make sure your membership is active through at least **June 16th, 2025**.  
If it isn’t, renew it—even Free memberships need to be up to date.

---

### 4. Sharing a tent?
If someone is staying in your tent, they’ll need to select the "Existing Tent" ticket type when ordering, or you can add that ticket for them when you check out. Be sure to include your site number during checkout.

> **Note**: TRC charges per person, not per campsite, so everyone needs their own camping arrangement—either through this event, a direct booking with TRC, or by joining an existing tent.

---

### 5. Final Note
Once you’ve checked out, you won’t be able to change your tag name or TRC member details. Don’t worry—we’ll follow up with everyone about 30 days before the event to provide a way to update that info.
