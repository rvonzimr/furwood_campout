## How to Book Your Spot at Furwood

Follow these steps to get registered and join the pack:

### 1. Grab Your TRC Membership Info
- **New to TRC?** Sign up here: [https://camptrc.org/Join](https://camptrc.org/Join).  
  You'll need a limited membership to camp. If you want to support TRC year-round, you're also welcome to become a regular member and join the amazing TRC community!
- **Already signed up?** Log in here: [https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile](https://camptrc.org/Sys/Profile).

Once logged in, take note of the following:
- **Your membership level**: It should say "Limited Membership - Free" or "Regular Membership."
- **Your User ID**: You’ll need this for your ticket.

### 2. Check your renewal date
Make sure your membership is active through at least **June 16th, 2025**.  
If it isn’t, renew it—even Free memberships need to be up to date.

### 3. Sharing a tent?
If someone is staying in your tent, they’ll need to select the "Existing Tent" ticket type when ordering, or you can add that ticket for them when you check out. Be sure to include your site number during checkout.

> **Note**: TRC charges per person, not per campsite, so everyone needs their own camping arrangement—either through this event, a direct booking with TRC, or by joining an existing tent.

### 5. Looking for RV spots?
Book directly through TRC and choose the BYO camping ticket option - TRC RV booking page

### 4. Final Note
Once you’ve checked out, you won’t be able to change your tag name or TRC member details. Don’t worry—we’ll follow up with everyone about 30 days before the event to provide a way to update that info.
